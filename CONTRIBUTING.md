# Contributing to 3D Printer Monitor

First off, thank you for considering contributing to 3D Printer Monitor. It's people like you that make 3D Printer Monitor such a great tool.

## Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, make one! It's generally best if you get confirmation of your bug or approval for your feature request this way before starting to code.

## Fork & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, then fork and create a branch with a descriptive name.

## Get the test suite running

Make sure you're using the latest version of Python. Install the necessary dependencies:

Run the tests to ensure everything is working:

## Implement your fix or feature

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first.

## Make a Pull Request

At this point, you should switch back to your master branch and make sure it's up to date with the latest changes:

Then update your feature branch from your local copy of master, and push it!

Go to the repository and make a Pull Request. The title should be clear, concise, and understandable. The body should be detailed and explain what changes were made, why you made them, and what impact they will have on the project.

## Keeping your Pull Request updated

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

To learn more about rebasing in Git, there are a lot of good resources but here's the suggested workflow:

## Merging a PR (maintainers only)

A PR can only be merged into master by a maintainer if:

- It is passing CI.
- It has been approved by at least two maintainers. If it was a maintainer who opened the PR, only one extra approval is needed.
- It has no requested changes.
- It is up to date with current master.

Any maintainer is allowed to merge a PR if all of these conditions are met.
